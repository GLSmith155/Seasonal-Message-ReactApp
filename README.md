# Weather-Message-ReactApp
A React App that detects latitude of the user as well as the month, and based on that info they are greeted with a seasonally relevant message.

index.js
The project functions by using a class component named App where we initialize the state outside of the constructor method since there was no need for anything to be inside. The method componentDidMount is then used to load the initial data, which gets the latitude of a user using geolocation, as well as set's the state as an error message if the latitude is not found, or if the user doesn't have location services enabled. Next the render method has two if statements, and then an implied else statement. This makes it so that if there's an error, and no latitude found, the user is notified with an error message. If there isn't an error, and if a latitude is found, then the class component named SeasonDisplay is rendered into the DOM. This is done by taking the component SeasonDisplay and giving it a prop named lat that has a value of {this.state.lat}, which is one of two values created in the when the state initializes.

SeasonDisplay.js
There are two functions and a class component in the SeasonDisplay.js file. The first function named getSeason determines the correct season using the latitude of the user and month. The class component named SeasonDisplay works with the remaining function named seasonConfig to create a ternary expression. Inside the class component a const variable with the main object of { text, iconName } is equalled to the outer function named seasonConfig. seasonConfig is just defining what the text and icon value of each season should be. And then in the component class we return two of the icons for whatefver season is selected, and we call the text once in a h1 header.
